# FMEM_Dashboard

exposure_management_dashboard
Creating a dashboard in Python Streamlit using various other packages as well for exposure management

VERY IMPORTANT: TODO: At the moment, the application only works Anaconda, its Visual Studio Editor and the local (not in a cloud) file version (in my case C:\Users\d.tychev\Documents). NEEDS A FIX!

HOW TO RUN THE FILE (at the moment): #TODO: make it easier to start

Programme the code in Microsoft Visual Studio Code run from Anaconda Navigator, so that you can start the programme in Python Streamlit web application
Run the programme from there To save the code in Github one needs to do the following
Save a local copy of the corresponding Python file (.py) on your disc C (for instance C:\Users\d.tychev\Repositories\exposure_management_dashboard\exposure_management_dashboard) where your Github repository is located at.
Then, open your PCs version of Microsoft Visual Studio Code
Now, commit and afterwards push the file into the repository
